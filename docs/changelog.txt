- Info: Are enemies in groups, or act as individuals?
    - 1:1 (old wizardry, old games in general)
        - easy to implement, and BlueRose is not focused on combat (but very retro/limited aproach)
    - 1 vs a lot of individuals (enemies, that are in one room, will attack together, group created dynamically?)
        - interesting option. In this case, even player has options like bribe, scary oponents etc.
        - not all enemies have to attack!
        - some of enemies may fear hero and run away, or do not attack!
        - enemies can fight between themselves!
        - individals can individualy move, creating other groups in different places...
        - issues: ilogic groups, like warriors + rats + undead in the same team!
    winner -> 1 vs group (group should be defined, Legend of grimrock etc., logic aproach)
        - enemies still have options like runaway, if they are scared
        - bribe, negotiations can be achieved with group boss (if present)
        - more logic, e.g.: "2 guards + dog" make a sense. They still can move as a group
    - 1 vs group (complete egroup is 1 UC/OC, not individuals)
