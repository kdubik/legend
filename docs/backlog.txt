PARTIALLY SOLVED
- rework loading LM files. When item is not declared first,
  that it is not possible to add it into the room etc. [partially fixed]

BACKLOG - SEQUEL
* implement random combat encounters [probably in game sequel]
* implement dialogues [probably in game sequel]
* possibility to pick up items? [probably in game sequel]
* implemented movement also for enemies (enemies group) [probably in game sequel ??]

BACKLOG
* implement experience, character progress
* implement focuses
* EQUIP at the beginning of the game: should be somewhere defined more correctly
* add more items
* change item (equip) in invertory should be reworked
* implement standard "game strings" to be loaded from lM file

CLOSER BACKLOG:
* add an option to actions/npcs/enemies/enemygroups/actions, how to show their name in slovak (sklonovanie: pouzil si... studňu, vidis... studňu atď.)
* combat updates:
    * make combat slower, so player can catch, what is going on
    * give treasure to player after successful combat
    * solve situation, when player runs away from battle
        * there is a small chance, that player will be hurt during escape
        * there is a some chance, that runaway is not possible
* continue experiments: 
    * use better way to scan user keyboard (use "textutils" lib)
    * bigger GUI redesign
* refactor: 2x battle check routines are present (not important now, only few lines of code)
* add more characters (whole game)
* implement SAVE/LOAD functions
* implement CHEATS (for easier debuging of game)
